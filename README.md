# user_pods

user_pods is a ScienceData application for creating and managing Kubernetes pods. More precisely it is an ownCloud app made specifically for the ownCloud installation at sciencedata.dk: It provides a web interface for managing Kubernetes pods - and depends on the [ScienceData Kubernetes service](https://github.com/deic-dk/sciencedata_kubernetes), which, in turn, depends on additional apps ([files_sharding](https://github.com/deic-dk/files_sharding) and [chooser](https://github.com/deic-dk/chooser)) installed on sciencedata.dk.
