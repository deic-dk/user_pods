# user_pods

This is a ScienceData application for creating and managing Kubernetes pods. More precisely, this is an ownCloud app made specifically for the ownCloud installation at sciencedata.dk: It depends both on additional apps ([files_sharding](https://github.com/deic-dk/files_sharding) and [chooser](https://github.com/deic-dk/chooser)) installed there and on additional services - Kubernetes, NFS and WebDAV, [integrated](https://github.com/deic-dk/sciencedata_kubernetes) with the ownCloud/Nextcloud service.
